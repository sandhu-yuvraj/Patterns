/*Floyd's triangle is a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers 
  used in computer science education, named after computer scientist Robert Floyd. 
  It is built by filling the rows with consecutive numbers starting from 1, 
  where the first row contains one number, the second has two, and so on.*/
